                        <p>"I’ve always been into athletics. When I entered high school I wanted to become an athletic
                            therapist or a trainer. I played competitive soccer and lacrosse throughout high school. But
                            when I was 18, I injured my knee in soccer. I had two knee surgeries. It was my first year
                            of university. I put on some weight because I wasn’t as active as I wanted to be. I battled
                            an anxiety disorder and depression. Physical activity was how I managed everything. I wanted
                            to be a personal trainer because I want to help people live their ideal life. I would like
                            people to live a long, healthy, and independent life. And it’s not that hard. You don’t have
                            to be an athlete. You just have to move a bit."</p>
